# CPW 219-eCommerceSite

A eCommerce site that is based around lectures/labs done in class.

My project specifically is around knicknacks and merch surrounding all the things I specifically love such as cats, dogs, Halloween, history, and science.

There is a variety of different merchandise such as t-shirts, kitten statues, replicated human skulls, and other things to be added as time goes on.

**WARNING: THERE IS NO STUFF FOR SALE, THIS IS A PROJECT FOR CLASS AND AS SUCH IS NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.**

You must have internet access and a GitHub account. This is vital otherwise you won't be able to see the project code (if that's what you want to look at).
